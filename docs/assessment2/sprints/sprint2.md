# Sprint 2

The Boats and Obstacles Sprite creation was not fully completed in Sprint 1, hence it was finalised during Sprint 2. We then began to spend time understanding the codebase. This was highlighted as very important because testing required all testers to have a complete working understanding of the codebase and for future feature implementation. 
In addition to this, outlining Black Box test cases started alongside changing the existing Risk, Method Selection and Planning and Architecture deliverable because the changes to Requirements had been made in the previous Sprint.
