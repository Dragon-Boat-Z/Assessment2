# Sprint 7

After Exams we moved to 2-week Sprints to accommodate the increased number of tasks and decided to have an additional meeting each week.
The Sprint would cover finalising Black Box Test cases, writing the traceability matrix and conducting the first Black Box test of the current system.
As we would begin implementing missing and new features, White Box testing should be written before this process. As a perquisite to this, we all needed to understand Junit and Mockito. 
As CI Infrastructure had been setup in the GitHub repository, we began writing up the CI deliverable.
